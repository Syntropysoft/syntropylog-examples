# Example 03: TypeScript Context with Interfaces

This example demonstrates how to use SyntropyLog with TypeScript, leveraging static typing for context management and logging. It shows a complete application with proper initialization, context propagation, and graceful shutdown.

## 🎯 The "Why"

TypeScript provides several advantages when working with SyntropyLog:

- **Type-Safe Configuration**: Full autocomplete and error checking for configuration objects
- **Interface-Based Context**: Define clear contracts for your context data
- **Better Developer Experience**: IDE support for logger methods and context properties
- **Compile-Time Safety**: Catch errors before runtime

## 🏗️ Architecture

This example demonstrates:

1. **TypeScript Interfaces**: Define context structure with interfaces
2. **Context Propagation**: Automatic correlation across function calls
3. **Boilerplate Pattern**: Reusable initialization and shutdown functions
4. **ClassicConsoleTransport**: Familiar console output format
5. **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper lifecycle management

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this example is to show:

1. **TypeScript Integration**: How to use SyntropyLog with TypeScript
2. **Interface-Based Context**: Define and use typed context data
3. **Complete Boilerplate**: Initialization, context management, and shutdown
4. **Context Propagation**: Automatic correlation across services
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error logging with context

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   From the `03-context-ts` directory, run:
    ```bash
   npm install --no-workspaces
    ```

   > **⚠️ Important**: Use `--no-workspaces` flag to avoid npm workspace conflicts when installing dependencies in individual examples.

2. **Run the Example**:
    ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Graceful Shutdown**:
   Press `Ctrl+C` to test the graceful shutdown behavior.

## 📊 Expected Output

You should see output similar to this:

```

## 🔍 Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. **TypeScript Interfaces**
```typescript
interface UserContext {
  correlationId: string;
  userId: string;
  sessionId: string;
}
```

### 2. **Context Propagation**
- Automatic correlation across all function calls
- Type-safe context access
- No manual context passing required

### 3. **Complete Boilerplate**
- Event-driven initialization
- Graceful shutdown with signal handlers
- Error handling throughout the lifecycle

### 4. **ClassicConsoleTransport**
- Familiar console output format
- Easy to read and parse
- Compatible with existing logging tools

### 5. **Service Integration**
- Multiple services working together
- Shared context across service boundaries
- Consistent logging format

## 🏗️ Code Structure

### Boilerplate Functions
- **`initializeSyntropyLog()`**: Standard initialization with event listeners
- **`gracefulShutdown()`**: Proper shutdown with signal handling
- **`main()`**: Application orchestration

### Example Logic
- **`UserContext`**: TypeScript interface for context data
- **`userService.processRequest()`**: Example service with context
- **`authService.validateUser()`**: Example service with context

### Configuration
```typescript
await syntropyLog.init({
  logger: {
    level: 'info',
    serviceName: 'typescript-context-example',
    transports: [new ClassicConsoleTransport()],
  },
  context: {
    correlationIdHeader: 'X-Correlation-ID'
  }
});
```

## 💡 Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Compile-time error checking
2. **Better IDE Support**: Autocomplete and IntelliSense
3. **Clear Contracts**: Interfaces define expected data structure
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to refactor and update
5. **Developer Experience**: Faster development with fewer runtime errors

## 🎯 Next Steps

After understanding TypeScript integration, explore:

- **Example 10**: HTTP correlation with real web servers
- **Example 11**: Custom adapters for specific clients
- **Example 13**: Framework agnosticism between adapters
