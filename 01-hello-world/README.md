# Example 01: Hello World - Basic Logging

This example demonstrates basic logging with SyntropyLog. It includes minimal initialization and graceful shutdown, focusing on logging concepts.

## Prerequisites

This example is self-contained, but for a deeper understanding of initialization patterns, see [Example 00: Setup & Initialization](./00-setup-initialization/README.md).

## Purpose

The goal of this example is to show:

1. **Getting a Logger**: How to obtain a logger instance
2. **Log Levels**: Using different log levels (info, warn, error)
3. **Structured Logging**: Adding metadata to your logs
4. **Error Logging**: Proper error logging with context

## Key Concepts

### Logger Instances
Each part of your application can have its own logger instance with a unique name, making it easier to identify where logs come from.

### Log Levels
Different log levels help categorize the importance and type of information being logged:
- **info**: General information about application flow
- **warn**: Warning conditions that don't stop execution
- **error**: Error conditions that need attention

### Structured Logging
Instead of string concatenation, use objects to add context to your logs. This makes logs more searchable and analyzable.

### Critical: Initialization & Shutdown
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Initialization and shutdown are **essential** for log integrity:

- **Initialization**: Ensures SyntropyLog is ready to process logs
- **Shutdown**: **Guarantees all pending logs are sent before the process terminates**
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Prevents log loss when the pod dies or restarts

> **üí° Pro Tip**: In production, always implement signal handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT) to ensure graceful shutdown. See [Example 00: Setup & Initialization](./00-setup-initialization/README.md) for advanced patterns.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   From the `01-hello-world` directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm install --no-workspaces
   ```
   
   > **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Use `--no-workspaces` flag to avoid npm workspace conflicts when installing dependencies in individual examples.

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Expected Output

You should see output similar to this:

```

```

### Performance Notes

‚ö° **Notice the Speed**: The entire example runs in just **2 milliseconds** (from 47.461Z to 47.463Z)! This demonstrates SyntropyLog's high-performance design:

- **Non-blocking operations**: Logging doesn't block your application
- **Efficient serialization**: Fast JSON serialization of log data
- **Optimized shutdown**: Quick cleanup of resources
- **Minimal overhead**: Framework adds negligible latency to your operations

## Code Structure

### Boilerplate (Reusable)
- **`initializeSyntropyLog()`**: Standard initialization - **ALWAYS REQUIRED**
- **`shutdownSyntropyLog()`**: Graceful shutdown - **CRITICAL for production**

### Example Logic
- **`demonstrateLogging()`**: Example-specific logic (logging)
- **`main()`**: Orchestration of steps

### Why This Structure?
- **Separation of concerns**: Boilerplate vs specific logic
- **Reusability**: Initialization functions can be copied to other examples
- **Clarity**: It's obvious what's critical vs what's example-specific

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Logger Names**: Choose names that identify the component or module
2. **Add Context**: Always include relevant metadata with your logs
3. **Structured Data**: Use objects instead of string concatenation
4. **Error Context**: Include error details and context when logging errors
5. **üö® ALWAYS Initialize and Shutdown**: Never skip initialization or shutdown - this guarantees log integrity
6. **Handle Process Signals**: In production, implement SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers for graceful shutdown
7. **Copy Boilerplate**: Use the initialization/shutdown functions as templates for your applications

## Next Steps

After understanding basic logging, proceed to [Example 10: Basic Context](./10-basic-context/README.md) to learn about automatic context propagation.
