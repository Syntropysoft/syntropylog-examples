# Example 23: Full-Stack Correlation with Kafka

This example demonstrates one of the most powerful features of `syntropylog`: **end-to-end context correlation** across different services communicating via a message broker (in this case, Kafka).

## Architecture

This example simulates a producer and a consumer running in the same process but architected as if they were separate microservices. The key is how `syntropylog` seamlessly propagates the `X-Correlation-ID` from the producer's context to the consumer's context through the message headers.

The project follows a clean, modular structure:

1. **`src/config.ts`**: Contains the SyntropyLog configuration using official framework types. Defines the Kafka adapter configuration and logging settings.

2. **`src/boilerplate.ts`**: Handles SyntropyLog initialization and graceful shutdown. Provides reusable lifecycle management functions.

3. **`src/index.ts`**: The main application entry point. It orchestrates the example:
   * Initializes SyntropyLog using the boilerplate
   * Connects to Kafka broker
   * Sets up a consumer that subscribes to the topic
   * Creates a producer context with correlation ID
   * Publishes a message and demonstrates correlation preservation

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, please ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v18 or higher is recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose

## How to Run

### Step 1: Start Kafka Infrastructure

First, start the required Kafka infrastructure:

```bash
# Navigate to the example directory
cd examples/23-kafka-full-stack

# Start Kafka and Zookeeper
docker compose up -d
```

Wait a few seconds for Kafka to be ready.

### Step 2: Run the Example

Once Kafka is running, install dependencies and run the example:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the example
npm run dev
```

### Alternative: Start Everything at Once

If you prefer to start everything together:

```bash
docker compose up -d && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Expected Output

When you run the example, you will see a series of logs demonstrating the correlation flow. The most important thing to observe is that the `X-Correlation-ID` generated in the "producer" context is the same one that appears in the "consumer" logs, proving that the context was successfully propagated through Kafka.

**Key Observations:**
- âœ… **Producer correlation ID**: `a1c930a9-b0ac-4ef3-a979-ba245d99fcfd`
- âœ… **Consumer correlation ID**: Same ID (shown as Buffer but represents the same value)
- âœ… **Message payload**: Successfully transmitted as "Hello, distributed world!"
- âœ… **Automatic correlation**: No manual header passing required
