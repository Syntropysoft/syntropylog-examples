# Example 50: Basic Kafka Correlation

This example demonstrates how to implement a custom **Broker Adapter** for Kafka. It showcases one of the core strengths of SyntropyLog: its decoupled, adapter-based architecture for message brokers.

By creating a simple `KafkaAdapter`, we can instrument any `kafkajs`-based communication, enabling automatic context propagation and centralized logging for distributed systems.

## Key Concepts

- **Broker Adapter Pattern**: Instead of being tied to a specific broker library, you provide an adapter that conforms to the `IBrokerAdapter` interface.
- **Context Propagation**: The `correlationId` is automatically added to message headers by the producer and extracted by the consumer, linking distributed operations.
- **Singleton Client**: The Kafka client and adapter are instantiated once and shared across the application, which is a common best practice.

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, you must first build the main `syntropylog` library from the project's root directory:

```bash
# From the project root
npm run build
```

## Running the Example

1.  **Start Services with Docker Compose:**
    From the **root of the project**, start all the necessary services (including Kafka) using the main `docker-compose.yaml` file.

    ```bash
    # From the project root
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3.  **Run the example:**
    First, compile the TypeScript code. Then, run the start script.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

4.  **Stop Services:**
    When you're finished, you can stop all services from the **root of the project**.

    ```bash
    # From the project root
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Expected Output

You should see logs from both the producer and the consumer. You might see some initial connection errors from `kafkajs` while the Kafka cluster starts up, which is normal. The important part is that the `correlationId` is the same for both the producer and consumer logs.
